  1. Fork your own version of this repo

    <!--
      In this section (<body>), create a h1 tag stating your name
      Beneath that, create an unordered list with at least 3 list items
      that describe your web development experience (if any, it's ok if this is all new :D)

      This is just a quick exercise to show that you know how to work with git and GitHub
      No styling or scripting is required for this assignment

      If you don't know how to make the above mentioned tags, either take a look around on
      the internet, or don't hesitate to ask me!

    <ul>
      <li>I created this <a href="http://www.mackinengineering.com/">site</a> as I was learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's not perfect but I learned a lot while making it.</li>
      <li>I don't know very much about server side programming (yet) which is why I'm taking this class. I had help setting up the backend of the above site and used a Yeoman MEAN stack generator.</li>
      <li>I want to pursue a career in web development!</li>
