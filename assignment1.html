    <h1>Stacy Mackin</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>I created this <a href="http://www.mackinengineering.com/">site</a> as I was learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's not perfect but I learned a lot while making it.</li>
      <li>I don't know very much about server side programming (yet) which is why I'm taking this class. I had help setting up the backend of the above site and used a Yeoman MEAN stack generator.</li>
      <li>I want to pursue a career in web development!</li>
